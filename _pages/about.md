I am a marine microbial ecologist whose research integrates microbial ecology, plastid evolution, and genomics to understand the diversity, function, and evolution of protistan symbioses in marine systems. My work combines field-sampling and ecology with molecular and computational approaches to address fundamental questions about the ecology and evolution of host-microbe interactions.

# Research Themes
- Microbiomes and their contribution to host resiliency
- Host-microbe interactions
- Marine apicomplexan ecology and evolution
- Novel marine protists
- Ecology of parasitism

# Recent Research Highlight
Check out [this recent publication in Environmental Microbiome](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40793-026-00852-4) describing the cryptic chromerid diversity of microbialites!
