# About Me
I am a marine microbial ecologist whose research integrates microbial ecology, plastid evolution, and genomics to understand the diversity, function, and evolution of protistan symbioses in marine systems. My work combines field-sampling and ecology with molecular and computational approaches to address fundamental questions about the ecology and evolution of host-microbe interactions.

# Research Themes
- Microbiomes and their contribution to host resiliency
- Host-microbe interactions
- Marine apicomplexan ecology and evolution
- Novel marine protists
- Ecology of parasitism

# Recent Research Highlights

* ***Had a great time writing [this review on marine apicomplexans](https://academic.oup.com/icb/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/icb/icag006/8471538) published in SICB's Integrative and Comparative Biology!***
